Description:
  This Delphi class plays .mp3 files using mci commands
  and edits ID3 v1.1 records which are set at the end of 
  the .mp3 file

  An object built from this class represents a single .mp3 file
  and as such can be played, stopped, paused, resumed, and a 
  v1.1 ID3 record can be edited/saved with the file.

  Progress and Completion events are available for use during 
  play of the .mp3 file

  This class is released as sample code; it is well commented;
  use it, learn from it; all information presented here was 
  gleaned from general Delphi knowledge and various sites on
  the internet which are publicly available.

  If you have questions, feel free to contact me at the email

  A sample program which shows many of the funcitons of the
